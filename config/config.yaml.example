# Hailo Detector Configuration File
# This is an example configuration with all available options and their defaults

# Video capture settings
video:
  # V4L2 device path (usually /dev/video0 for first camera)
  device: "/dev/video0"

  # Capture resolution - DJI Osmo Pocket 3 supports 1920x1080
  width: 1920
  height: 1080

  # Frames per second (30 is optimal for real-time detection)
  fps: 30

# Inference settings
inference:
  # Path to YOLOv8n HEF model file
  # This model is downloaded automatically during installation
  model_path: "/opt/hailo-detector/models/yolov8n.hef"

  # Confidence threshold for detections (0.0 to 1.0)
  # Lower values = more detections but more false positives
  # Higher values = fewer detections but more accurate
  confidence_threshold: 0.5

  # Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) threshold (0.0 to 1.0)
  # Used to eliminate overlapping bounding boxes
  # Lower values = more aggressive suppression
  nms_threshold: 0.45

  # Model input size (usually 640 for YOLOv8n)
  # Must match the model's expected input size
  input_size: 640

# Streaming settings
stream:
  # Bind address (0.0.0.0 = all interfaces, 127.0.0.1 = localhost only)
  host: "0.0.0.0"

  # HTTP server port
  port: 8080

  # JPEG compression quality (1-100)
  # Higher values = better quality but more bandwidth
  # 80 is a good balance for most use cases
  jpeg_quality: 80

# Logging configuration
logging:
  # Logging level: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
  # Use DEBUG for troubleshooting, INFO for normal operation
  level: "INFO"
